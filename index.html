    <p>Hi my name is manisha and I'm from Nepal. Is been 8 years now and I'm still excited as I was when I came to United States. I don't have any strong reason for choosing web devlopment. I do and the result makes me happy and everyday I learn new stuff. Fun fact about me is that since the day I graduate from high school, I start working with Promise South Salt Lake as prevention specialist. Is after school program where I help with their homework. I'm not a movie person and I really don't have any favorite movie but if I had to chose a gener than I would go with animation. Music is my life so I like all geners songs.   </p>
